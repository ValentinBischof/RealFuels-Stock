RealFuels-Stock for BDB 1.7dev
Current State: ALPHA


These are engine and tank configurations for BDB 1.7dev up to the CentaurD RL10 addition even though RealFuels is prety incompatible with B9PartSwitch configurations but most of it is working. Variable tank sizes from newer BDB parts aren't supported. ModuleFuelTanks size references the default variant. 

Configs are based on the configs in BD_Extras although they've been completely overhauled since there's been a lot of changes to BDB since that was released.

All engines featured in BDB 1.7dev have RF versions of their B9 configs including appropriate variant fuels such as the HDA 8096 and RP-1 powered Titan engines configured. There's even a few extra configs and more variants are planned based on spelunking through RO configs*

All engines make use of techlevels for fine tuning and their subtype requirements have the appropriate tech requirement.

Nearly all the RCS should be flexible in its configuration and tech requirements are planned.

Thrust is based on BDB values and scaled RO values for extra configs. Currently testing whether each historical vehicle can fullfill the Historic Mission Contract pack launched with MechJebs PEG Ascent Guidance or Gravity Turn. 

B9Partswitch throws out a bunch of errors which can be ignored. Even with the partswitch patch the errors show so its disabled by default. Enable it by renaming its extension to ".cfg" The purpose of the patch is to prevent B9Partswitch from messing with the engine stats.

*Could possibly future proof for future BDB updates as well as provide a base for any mods engines based on real engines.
