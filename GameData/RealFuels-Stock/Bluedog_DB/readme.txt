RealFuels-Stock for BDB 1.8
Current State: 1.2 - Yellow is the new Black

These are engine and tank configurations for BDB 1.8 and some part mods meant to be integrated with BDB such as Hephaistos and the X-20 Moroz. 

If you're updating your RF BDB configuration from 1.1 to 1.2 delete everything inside the GameData\RealFuels-Stock\Bluedog_DB  and place the contents of the zip in your GameData\RealFuels-Stock\ folder.

Configs are based on the original BDB RF for BDB 1.6. Thrust is based on BDB values and scaled RO values for extra configs. Tested at 3.2x scale.

Variable tank sizes from newer BDB parts using B9PartSwitch aren't supported. As a workaround each tank is duplicated, sensibly renamed and their B9PartSwitch selection limited. 

All engines featured in BDB 1.8d have RF versions of their B9 configs including appropriate variant fuels such as the HDA 8096 and RP-1 powered Titan engines configured. There's even a few extra configs and more variants are planned based on spelunking through RO configs and Astronautix.

As a KSP first there are now yellow plumes for Fluorine based engines configurations! Have fun burning concrete and leaving a trail of death. Good thing they're orbital engines. 

RF anbd B9 integration ensures you only have to deal with one menu when swapping between engines - the visuals (Plumes, engine assembly and noxxle) will be set accordingly. 

Nearly all the RCS should be flexible in its configuration and have appropriate tech requirements.

An optional patch for TAC users with 24h days is available. Consumption rates are divided by 4 as the supplies added by BDB TAC patches are based on 6h days but only works on a new game.
