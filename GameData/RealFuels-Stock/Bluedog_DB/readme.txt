These are engine and tank configurations for BDB 1.7dev up to the CentaurD addition even though RealFuels is prety much incompatible with the B9PartSwitch configurations.

Configs are based on the configs in BD_Extras although they've been overhauled since there's been a lot of changes to BDB since that was released. 

All engines featured in BDB 1.7dev have configs including variant fuels such as the HDA 8096 and RP-1 powered Titan 2+ engines. 

All engines have configs that match up to the B9 configs, select the B9 config first to get the mesh then select the RF config.

All engines also make use of RealFuels upgrade system for fine tuning.

Nearly all the RCS should be flexible in its configuration.
